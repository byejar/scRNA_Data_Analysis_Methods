## Single-Cell RNA (scRNA) Data Analysis Methods

1. **scRNA_pipline+fig**: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis pipeline with figure generation.

2. **scRNA+cybersort+TCGA survival**: Combines scRNA-seq with **CIBERSORT** to estimate immune cell composition, followed by integration with **TCGA survival analysis**.

3. **scRNA+public data**: Integrates scRNA-seq with publicly available datasets for comparative or meta-analysis.

4. **scRNA+cellchat**: Applies **CellChat** for cell-cell communication inference and interaction network analysis based on scRNA-seq data.

5. **scRNA+CopyKAT**: Uses **CopyKAT** (Copy number karyotyping of tumors) to detect genomic copy number variations (CNVs) in single-cell RNA data.

6. **scRNA+spRNA**: Integrates spatial transcriptomics with single-cell RNA sequencing to study gene expression in spatial contexts.

7. **scRNA+compass**: Uses **COMPASS** to quantify functional gene expression diversity in scRNA-seq data.
